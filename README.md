Compares a League of Legends player's recent in-game performance with that of their friends.

## What Is It?

Friendly Competition is different than services like OP.GG. Instead of only displaying stats from your recent League games, it shows how you stack up against people that you play with.

## How It Works

Friendly Competition looks at your 10 most recent games (whether they are ranked, normals, ARAM, or anything else) and compares your performance to 3 other players who appear the most often in those games.

## Motivation

I mostly check my stats on op.gg to compare myself with my friends. I was tired of flipping back and forth between multiple op.gg tabs, and I wanted to learn the basics of Node.js, so I set out to build a service that showed me my stats relative to other people that I play with.
